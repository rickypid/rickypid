My name is Riccardo, also known as PID, and I have been passionate about technology since I was 13 years old. Since then, I have nurtured my passion for programming in various fields, starting as a self-taught programmer and developing Basic software for small obstacle-avoiding rovers.

Throughout my career, I have deepened my knowledge, specializing in software development for industrial automation. For over 15 years, I have been developing software for systems in various sectors, including automotive, food, packaging, and energy production.

Recently, I have focused on developing cross-platform applications for Windows, Web, Android, and iOS using Flutter, as well as backend and API solutions in JavaScript/TypeScript. Together with a close friend, I founded InsideApp, a company dedicated to creating software with the aim of enhancing our expertise and delivering quality solutions to clients.

I have always been fascinated by technology, but my true passion lies in programming and solving complex problems. I constantly seek new challenges that allow me to test and expand my skills.

In my experience with Flutter, I have also contributed to the open-source community by developing libraries to share my work and improve or extend others' projects.

I am a curious and passionate person, always eager to discover what new challenges the future holds. Programming is not just my professionâ€”itâ€™s my passion, and I approach it with enthusiasm every day.

In the last few years I have grown into and use Flutter a lot. I try to develop libraries to share my work and help improve or extend other people's libraries.
