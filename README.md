My name is Riccardo, also known as PID, and I have been passionate about technology since I was 13 years old. Since then, I have developed my passion for programming in many areas, starting as a self-taught programmer and creating Basic software for small obstacle-avoiding rovers.

Over the years, I have deepened my programming knowledge, developing software in the field of industrial automation. Thanks to my school internships, I had the opportunity to enter this world and have continued to make programming my profession for over 15 years. During this time, I have developed software for systems in various sectors, including automotive, food, packaging, and energy production.

In recent years, I have developed cross-platform applications for Windows, Web, Android, and iOS in Flutter, as well as web backend/APIs in Javascript/TypeScript. Together with a close friend, I founded InsideApp, a company that develops software to take our knowledge to a higher level and bring our expertise to our clients.

I am very interested in computer technology, but what I am most passionate about is programming in general and solving complex problems. I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to put my skills into practice.

I am very passionate about what I do, and nothing can stop my curiosity. Programming is my passion, and I look forward to discovering what new challenges the future holds.

I have been working in Italy in the automotive software sector for over 10 years.üßë‚Äçüíª

In the last few years I have grown into and use Flutter a lot. I try to develop libraries to share my work and help improve or extend other people's libraries.
